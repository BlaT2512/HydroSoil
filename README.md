Official Repository for the hydrOS, the operating system behind HydroSoil: Smart Irrigation Solutions.

# Installing, running and building hydrOS
The latest version of hydrOS comes standard with all official HydroSoil products, including HydroCore and HydroUnit products. The operating system can also be built from source code.
To build from source, install all dependencies for what you need as listed below.

## Dependencies
### hydrOS on HydroCore Linux package dependencies:
- python3 (latest version)
- libgtk-3-dev
- mosquitto
- mosquitto-clients
### hydrOS on HydroCore Python package dependencies:
- wireless
- wifi
- packaging
- paho-mqtt
### HydroUnit Standard C++ (Arduino) library dependencies:
- PubSubClient
- ESP8266WiFi (standard with the ESP8266 board package)

## Configuring HydroCore device for running hydrOS
First, connect the device to your desired WiFi network.
After this, configure the device by editing the Mosquitto configuration file with this command:

`sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`

Remove this line from the bottom of the file:

`include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d`

And then insert this at the bottom of the file:
```
allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/pwfile
listener 1883
```
You can then exit out of Nano and save the file. In the Linux terminal, enter the following:

`sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/pwfile SoilMeasurer`

When prompted for password, enter `HydroSoil123`

Once this is set up, change the device's hostname to `soilsystemmainunit`
Reboot the device.
