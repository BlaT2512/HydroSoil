Official Repository for the hydrOS, the operating system behind HydroSoil: Smart Irrigation Solutions.

# FYI: hydrOS is still in beta and unsuitable for stable use. Ensure you back up your data or run this in a safe environment if testing.

# Installing, running and building hydrOS
The latest version of hydrOS comes standard with all official HydroSoil products, including [HydroCore and HydroUnit products](https://hydrosoil.tk/products.html). The operating system can also be built from source code.
To build from source, install all dependencies for what you need as listed below.

## Dependencies
### hydrOS on HydroCore Linux package dependencies:
- Python 3 (python3) [latest version]
- Python GTK3 (libgtk-3-dev)
- Python GTK WebKit 3
- Mosquitto MQTT (mosquitto)
- Mosquitto MQTT Client (mosquitto-clients)
### hydrOS on HydroCore Python package dependencies:
- wireless
- wifi
- packaging
- paho-mqtt
### HydroUnit Standard C++ (Arduino) library dependencies:
- PubSubClient
- ESP8266WiFi (standard with the ESP8266 board package)

## Configuring HydroCore device for running hydrOS
First, connect the device to your desired WiFi network.
After this, configure the device by editing the Mosquitto configuration file with this command:

`sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`

Remove this line from the bottom of the file:

`include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d`

And then insert this at the bottom of the file:
```
allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/pwfile
listener 1883
```
You can then exit out of Nano and save the file. In the Linux terminal, enter the following:

`sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/pwfile SoilMeasurer`

When prompted for password, enter `HydroSoil123`

Once this is set up, change the device's hostname to `hydrosoilmainunit`

Reboot the device.
